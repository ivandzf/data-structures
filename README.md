# Data Structures
This repo is only for learning the data structures in many languages I have learned. In the future will add new language just to learn it, now it only supports a few, the list is bellow.

## Language
- [Go](https://github.com/ivandzf/data-structures/tree/main/go)
- [Rust](https://github.com/ivandzf/data-structures/tree/main/rust/src/bin)

## Which data structure ?
- [Linked List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list)
- [Hash Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table)
- [Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type))
- [Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type))
- [Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type))
- [Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure))

## Why ?
Data structure is a very good example for understanding how a language applies a variable to memory, every language has a different way.

Example: in Rust languange if we want to implement the doubly linked list which takes circular dependency and Rust has an ownership to make memory safety guarantees and disallow you to have a multiple ownership. But in Go language you are free to do that.
